## Gen X: The Real Loser Generation

“We suffer”, said Seneca, “more often in imagination than in reality.” [cite: 2516] The Stoic philosopher could have been talking about the generations. Members of Gen Z, born between 1997 and 2012, say that social media ruined their childhood. [cite: 2517] Millennials, between 1981 and 1996, complain that they cannot buy a house. [cite: 2518] Baby-boomers, between 1946 and 1964, grouse that they face an uncertain retirement. [cite: 2519]

Many forget about Generation X, which is made up of those born between 1965 and 1980. [cite: 2520] Proxied by Google searches the world is less than half as interested in Gen X as it is in millennials, Gen Zers or baby-boomers. [cite: 2520] There are few podcasts or memes about Gen X. [cite: 2521] Aside from Douglas Coupland’s “Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture”, a novel published in 1991 which popularised the moniker, there are few books discussing the cohort. [cite: 2521, 2522] In Britain Gen Xers are less likely than members of any other age group to know the generation to which they belong. [cite: 2523]

Gen Xers may have no place in the popular imagination but, contrary to Seneca, they really do suffer. [cite: 2524] This is true both because Gen Xers are at a tricky age, and also because the cohort itself is cursed. [cite: 2525] A recent 30-country poll by Ipsos finds that 31% of Gen Xers say they are “not very happy” or “not happy at all”, the most of any generation. [cite: 2526] David Blanchflower of Dartmouth College finds all sorts of nasty things, from unhappiness to anxiety to despair, top out around the age of 50. [cite: 2527] This is consistent with the “U-bend of life” theory, which suggests that people are happy when young and old, but miserable in middle age. [cite: 2527] Baby-boomers went through it; before long millennials will, too. [cite: 2528]

The U-bend exists in part because chronic health issues start to emerge in middle age. [cite: 2528] People also come to realise they will not achieve everything they had hoped in their careers. [cite: 2529] On top of this, Gen Xers often have to look after both their children and their parents. [cite: 2530] In America they devote 5% of their spending to caring for people under 18 or over 65, against just 2% for boomers. [cite: 2531] In Italy the share of 18-to-34-year-olds living with their parents has increased from 61% to 68% over the past two decades. [cite: 2532] In Spain the rise is even more dramatic. [cite: 2533] To which generation do many of these parents belong? Gen X. [cite: 2533, 2534]

Nowhere is life more U-shaped than in San Francisco. [cite: 2534] The city’s idealistic youngsters believe that they will start the next big artificial-intelligence company, and are willing to put up with high costs and crime. [cite: 2535] Successful boomers live in enormous houses in Pacific Heights and sit on company boards. [cite: 2536] Gen Xers, in the middle, have neither the idealism nor the sinecures. [cite: 2537] Only 37% are happy with life in San Francisco, compared with 63% of Gen Zers, according to a poll in 2022 by the San Francisco Standard, a local paper. [cite: 2538] Many have little option but to live in Oakland—the horror!—if they want a big house. [cite: 2539]

Although Gen Xers will in time escape the U-bend, they will remain losers in other ways. [cite: 2540] Consider their incomes. Gen Xers do earn more after inflation than earlier generations—the continuation of a long historical trend, and one from which both millennials and Gen Zers also benefit. [cite: 2541, 2542] But their progress has been slow. [cite: 2543] A recent paper by Kevin Corinth of the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank, and Jeff Larrimore of the Federal Reserve assesses American household incomes by generation, after accounting for taxes, government transfers and inflation. [cite: 2543] From the ages of 36 to 40 Gen Xers’ real household incomes were only 16% higher than the previous generation at the same age, the smallest improvement of any cohort (see chart 1). [cite: 2544]

Perhaps this poor income growth is a consequence of a stereotype that a range of psychological studies have confirmed: Gen Xers are reluctant to be corporate drones, placing more emphasis on work-life balance and autonomy. [cite: 2545] It is no coincidence that in 1999, when Gen Xers were in the prime of their lives, there were two hugely successful films in which people broke free of life’s shackles. [cite: 2546] In “The Matrix” Thomas Anderson, a computer programmer, discovers the world is an illusion simulated by intelligent machines. [cite: 2547] In “Fight Club” an office worker joins a secret society whose members kick lumps out of each other. [cite: 2548] All very exciting, of course—but hardly conducive to a solid career. [cite: 2549]

Gen Xers have, to be fair, faced difficult circumstances. [cite: 2549] People’s earnings typically rise fast in their 30s and 40s, as they move into managerial roles. [cite: 2550] Unfortunately for Gen Xers, when they were in that age range labour markets were weak, following the global financial crisis of 2007-09. [cite: 2551] In 2011, for instance, the median nominal earnings of British people in their 30s rose by just 1.1%. [cite: 2552] Earnings growth in Italy, which was hit hard by the euro crisis, was just as poor. [cite: 2553] And in Canada from 2011 to 2017 the real median earnings of people aged 35 to 44 years did not grow at all. [cite: 2554]

Gen Xers have also done a poor job accumulating wealth. [cite: 2555] During the 1980s, when many boomers were in their 30s, global stockmarkets quadrupled. [cite: 2556] Millennials, now in their 30s, have so far enjoyed strong market returns. [cite: 2557] But during the 2000s, when Gen Xers were hoping to make hay, markets fell slightly. [cite: 2558] That period was a lost decade for American stocks in particular, coming after the dotcom bubble and ending with the financial crisis. [cite: 2559]

What about home-ownership, the ultimate symbol of intergenerational unfairness? [cite: 2560] The conventional narrative contrasts perma-renting millennials with boomers who enjoy six spare bedrooms. [cite: 2560] Yet data on American home-ownership, provided by Victoria Gregory of the St Louis branch of the Fed, overturns this received wisdom. [cite: 2561] In fact, the big decline in home-ownership rates happened from boomers to Gen Xers. [cite: 2562] Starting in their late 30s and early 40s, Gen Xers of a given age had a similar chance of owning as millennials do (see chart 2). [cite: 2563]

Aversion to home-ownership is in some cases a choice. [cite: 2564] Gen Xers may have imbibed a passage from Mr Coupland’s novel: “When someone tells you they’ve just bought a house, they might as well tell you they no longer have a personality.” [cite: 2564] But, again, circumstances are probably a bigger factor. [cite: 2565] From their late 30s to their early 40s, the time when many people first get on the housing ladder, Gen Xers suffered from the effects of the financial crisis. [cite: 2565] It became hard to get a mortgage. [cite: 2566] Some of those who already had one foreclosed on their house and went back to renting. [cite: 2566]

Aggregate statistics capture all these trends. [cite: 2567] Jeremy Horpedahl of the University of Central Arkansas tracks average wealth by generation, using data produced by the Fed. [cite: 2567] He finds that, at 31, the millennial/Gen Z cohort has about double the wealth that the average Gen Xer had at the same age. [cite: 2568] Using survey data from the European Central Bank we find suggestive evidence of similar trends in Europe. [cite: 2569] From 2010 to 2021, millennials in the euro area tripled their nominal net worth, versus less than a doubling for Gen Xers. [cite: 2570, 2571]

The position of Gen Xers may not improve much in the years ahead. [cite: 2572] They could be the first to suffer owing to broken pension systems. [cite: 2573] America’s social-security fund is projected to be depleted by 2033—just as Gen Xers start to retire—meaning benefits will be cut by 20-25% unless Congress acts. [cite: 2574] Next time you see a quinquagenarian, at least give them a smile. [cite: 2575]
