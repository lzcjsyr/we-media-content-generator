**China’s universities are wooing Western scientists**
And they are reaching beyond academics with Chinese heritage
May 22nd 2025

Charles lieber had few options[cite: 1224]. On April 28th the renowned former Harvard chemist took up a new post at Tsinghua University’s Shenzhen campus[cite: 1225]. Mr Lieber had been looking for a perch after he was convicted in America in 2021 for hiding ties to Chinese research funding[cite: 1226]. He is one of a handful of senior Western scholars who have recently taken up posts in China[cite: 1227]. Others have done so more from a position of choice[cite: 1228].

The websites of Peking University and Tsinghua University, respectively, recently confirmed that Gérard Mourou, a French Nobel-prizewinning physicist, and Kenji Fukaya, a decorated Japanese mathematician, were joining their faculties[cite: 1228]. This month Alex Lamb, an ai researcher, confirmed he was leaving a lab at Microsoft in New York for Tsinghua’s new ai college[cite: 1229, 1230]. “I think that Tsinghua is a very good university,” Mr Lamb wrote in an email[cite: 1230, 1231]. “The quality of the undergraduate students is extremely strong and Tsinghua’s ability to recruit strong graduate students is rapidly improving.” [cite: 1231]

The scholars join a dozen leading scientists of Chinese heritage who have recently left Western colleges for China[cite: 1232]. They include Sun Song, a star mathematician at the University of California Berkeley, who moved to Zhejiang University, home of DeepSeek, an ai firm[cite: 1233]. “‘Talent’ is becoming as important a core goal of central planning to Beijing as ‘workers’ were under Mao,” wrote Jeroen Groenewegen and Antonia Hmaidi for merics, a European think-tank[cite: 1234]. In 2021, Xi Jinping set a goal to make China attract global talent by 2030 and be the top destination for the brightest by 2035[cite: 1235].

Recruiting from the West focuses on two groups: a small number of senior researchers like Mr Mourou, and a greater number of early-career bright sparks, like Mr Lamb[cite: 1235]. At a big Communist Party meeting in 2024, China’s leadership said it would refocus its efforts to attract foreign scholars, including by making it easier for skilled workers to move there[cite: 1236]. Universities have been more active in promoting national scholarship funds established in 2021 to woo foreigners[cite: 1237].

President Donald Trump’s re-election has caused a growing number of Western scholars to look east, says Yu Xie of Princeton University[cite: 1238]. More than half of the post-doctoral students in America are foreign, many of them Chinese[cite: 1239]. During Mr Trump’s first term, America’s justice department investigated many researchers with links to China, including Mr Lieber[cite: 1240]. Many of the cases failed in court, but had a chilling effect[cite: 1241]. More than half of Chinese and Chinese-American researchers thought about leaving America, says Mr Yu, and it is likely a few hundred did so[cite: 1242]. This time Mr Trump casts a broader shadow[cite: 1243]. He is reportedly planning $23bn in cuts over the next fiscal year to government-funded science[cite: 1243]. That is on top of a campaign against higher education, challenging the academic independence of institutions such as Harvard by holding their federal grants hostage[cite: 1244]. China’s state media recently crowed that uncertainty in America “is causing a broader community of scientists to lose confidence in building their careers there”[cite: 1245, 1246].

Funding cuts are forcing difficult trade-offs on scientists looking to continue their work[cite: 1246]. Though the gap between America and China in innovation has shrunk, China’s research ecosystem is still bureaucratic and hierarchical, and lacks true intellectual freedom[cite: 1246]. And disaffected boffins in America do have other choices[cite: 1246]. The European Union said on May 5th that it will spend €500m ($566m) courting them[cite: 1246].■
